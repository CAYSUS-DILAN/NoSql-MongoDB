# NoSql-MongoDB
NOSL (NoSQL Language) refers to the various query languages used with NoSQL databases. Unlike traditional SQL, NOSL supports diverse data models like document, key-value, and graph formats, allowing flexible and scalable data management. Each NoSQL database has its own query language tailored to its specific model.
       
       Project Overview: Introduction to NoSQL Databases
       Check the lab environment:
    You need the ‘couchimport’ and ‘couchexport’ tools to move data in and out of the Cloudant database.

    You need to obtain the content of the json file and copy the entire content: movies.json

    Create a new file named movie.json under the project directory and paste the entire content copied earlier into the newly created json file.

    Go to your Cloudant Service created on IBM Cloud and then click on Launch Dashboard to launch the cloudant databases. Then, click on New database on the top-right corner and create a Non-patitioned database named movies.
    1. Log in to IBM Cloud
    You need an IBM Cloud account to work with IBM Cloudant.
     If you do not have an account, you can sign up for one using the 
    instructions here.
    Step 1: Navigate to cloud.ibm.com.
    Step 2: Login using your IBM cloud credentials.
    You will land on the the Cloud Dashboard page.
    
    2.Create an IBM Cloudant instance
    Step 1: Click on cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant to create a 
    Cloudant instance.
    Or you can alternatively click on Create Resource, search for Cloudant 
    on the Dashboard page.
    You will be taken to the Cloudant instance creation page.

    Step 2: Select the region under the “Available regions”.
    It is OK to go with the default option, if you cannot figure out which 
    region to choose.
    Step 3: Scroll down to configure Cloudant instance.

    Step 4: Set your instance name to mycloudant or anything else that you prefer.
    Step 5: Authentication Method is a critical setting. Select “IAM and legacy Credentials” as your Authentication Method. If you choose any other Authentication Method, some labs will not work. Step 6: Select the Lite plan.
    Step 7: Click on Create

    You should see a screen like this
    Your Cloudant service will be created and you will be redirected to the Resource list page.
    Step 8: If you are not redirected, you can click on this link cloud.ibm.com/resources?groups=resource-instance
    You may see a screen like this, indicating the Provision in progress.
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2460f4a-1104-463b-ad3b-17f1a4e2968f)

    
    Step 9: Wait till the status turns ‘Active’ and click on mycloudant or your custom instance name.

    3.Create Cloudant Service credentials
         Step 1: On the Cloudant instance page, click on Service Credentials
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a144ee4b-8ded-4db3-8b08-9375f6d41dfa)

        Step 2: Click on New Credential.
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d286e55c-16a6-4e44-9701-6c7a81c532e0)
  
          Step 3: Create credential pop up appears. Accept the default 
         values for Name and Role and click on Add
     ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8f4e545-36ff-4086-833d-441866fb2b9f)

         
          Step 4: Your Cloudant Service credentials will be created. Click 
          on the chevron to view the credentials.
     DO NOT attempt to use the credentials shown here. These are expired 
       credentials.
       ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd3972fd-9459-4d67-82d3-63f25b495807)


       Step 5: You will be using the username, password and url in the next labs.
        ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/885e302e-cc0a-4532-905c-6f9723f03dc3)

       You have successfully created a Cloudant instance and Service 
        credentials for your instance.

    Note: If you do not see the password field in your credentials, it is because you have not selected “IAM and legacy credentials”. You can fix it by deleting your current Cloudant instance and following this lab from the beginning to create a new instance of Cloudant.


    #Export the json into your Cloudant Database:
    Go to your Cloudant Service created on IBM Cloud and then click on Launch Dashboard to launch the cloudant databases. Then, click on New database on the top-right corner and create a Non-patitioned database named movies.
    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef23c98b-6afc-4242-9e20-b932212fa321)

     Export the data of the “movie.json” file into your Cloudant database “movies”:
