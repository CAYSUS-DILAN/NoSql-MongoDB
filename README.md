# NoSql-MongoDB
NOSL (NoSQL Language) refers to the various query languages used with NoSQL databases. Unlike traditional SQL, NOSL supports diverse data models like document, key-value, and graph formats, allowing flexible and scalable data management. Each NoSQL database has its own query language tailored to its specific model.
